#一、下载samba-3.0.4.0.bff 
#二、将文件放在AIX系统的临时安装目录下，如：/usr/samba 
#三、 smit installp，将安装来源目录定位到/usr/samba下，安装； 

安装成功之后将会生成/opt/freeware/目录，此路径下的bin目录是samba的应用程序，sbin目录是samba的daemon，lib目录下的smb.conf是samba的配置文件。 
配置过程 
1.编辑/etc/samba/smb.conf/文件，一个简单的smb.conf文件示例如下： 
[global] 
workgroup = workgroup 
server string = Samba 3.0.4.0 
security = user 
encrypt passwords = Yes 
smb passwd file = /var/samba/private/smbpasswd 
log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m 
mangle case = Yes 
[homes] 
force user = %U 
read only = No 
hosts allow = 129.183. 
[printers] 
comment = All Printers 
path = /usr/spool/samba 
printable = Yes 
browseable = No 
[public] 
path = /jdlssoft/interface 
read only = no 
public = yes 
[root] 
comment = root directory 
path = / 
read only = no 
public = yes 

2. 检查/etc/services文件，看是否有如下几行： 
netbios-ns 137/tcp # NETBIOS Name Service 
netbios-ns 137/udp # NETBIOS Name Service 
netbios-dgm 138/tcp # NETBIOS Datagram Service 
netbios-dgm 138/udp # NETBIOS Datagram Service 
netbios-ssn 139/tcp # NETBIOS Session Service 
netbios-ssn 139/udp # NETBIOS Session Service 
swat 901/tcp # swat service of samba 
如果没有，则加上。 
3. 检查/etc/inetd.conf文件，看是否有如下几行： 
netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/samba/sbin/smbd smbd 
netbios-ns dgram udp wait root /usr/local/samba/sbin/nmbd nmbd 
swat stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/local/samba/sbin/swat swat 
如果没有，则加上。 
4. 由于AIX下与Windows下对密码处理认证方式不同，因此导致输入正确的密码时还是无法通过，因此要将smb.conf的encrypt passwords = Yes，Samba 3.0.1.0目前的版本默认的是Yes，smb密码文件默认为/usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd，可由SWAT工具修改； 
5. 执行/usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd -a xxx，密码与该用户操作系统密码相同，建立xxx用户的存取密码； 
如/usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd -a root 
6. refresh -s inetd，刷新inetd启动samba； 
7. 使用Windows的客户端共享访问，测试是否配置成功。

Starting the Samba server
Samba has two daemons, nmbd and smbd, that need to be running in order for Samba to work correctly.

nmbd is a server that understands and can reply to NetBIOS over IP name service requests, like those produced by SMB/CIFS clients such as Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and LanManager clients. It also participates in the browsing protocols that make up the Windows Network Neighborhood view.

smbd is the server daemon that provides the file-sharing and printing services to Windows clients. The server provides filespace and printer services to clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol.

These can be started from the command line as follows:

nmbd
smbd

Show more
The logs of these daemons can be found in the /var directory as log.nmbd and log.smbd, respectively.

These daemons can also be started automatically during system reboot by adding an entry into /etc/inittab, as follows:

mkitab nmb:2:once:/usr/sbin/nmbd
mkitab smb:2:once:/usr/sbin/smbd

Show more
Now the two daemons get started during every reboot. The daemons get listed in the process lists:

# ps -ef | grep mbd
root 667870 708792   0 12:49:24      -  0:00 smbd
root 675974      1   0 12:49:24      -  0:00 nmbd
root 708792      1   0 12:49:24      -  0:00 smbd

Show more
Creating users
New users can be created using the Password menu in SWAT or using the pdbedit utility:

# pdbedit -a guest
new password:
retype new password:

Show more
The new user to be added is essentially an AIX user. The password of existing users can be changed using the smbpasswd utility:

smbpasswd -U guest

Show more
Creating shares
New shares can be created by editing the smb.conf file or using the Shares menu in SWAT. The following is an example share definition from smb.conf:

[samba]
        path = /samba

Show more
Testing smb.conf
The contents of smb.conf can be tested using the testparm utility. If errors are listed, they can be solved by editing smb.conf and then be retested with the following utility:

# testparm /usr/lib/smb.conf
Load smb config files from /usr/lib/smb.conf
Processing section "[tmp]"
Processing section "[public]"
Loaded services file OK.
Server role: ROLE_STANDALONE
Press enter to see a dump of your service definitions

[global]
        workgroup = USERS

[samba]
        path = /samba

Show more
Testing connectivity
Connectivity to the share can be listed in the AIX machine using the smbclient utility:

# smbclient -L //beas.in.ibm.com/samba
Password:
Anonymous login successful
Domain=[USERS] OS=[UNIX] Server=[Samba 3.0.25b]

        Sharename       Type      Comment

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
        USERS

Show more
The share can also be connected using the smbclient utility:

# smbclient //beas.in.ibm.com/samba -U root
Password: Domain=[BEAS] OS=[UNIX] Server=[Samba 3.0.24]
smb: \>

Show more
The current directory can be checked as follows:

smb: \> pwd
Current directory is \\beas.in.ibm.com\samba

Show more
Server shutdown
The Samba server can be shut down as follows:

smbcontrol smbd shutdown
smbcontrol nmbd shutdown

Show more
Disconnect open shares
In order to disconnect open shares from the server machine, run the following command:

smbcontrol <process id of smbd> close-share <sharename>

Show more
For example:

[global]
dead time = 1

Show more
Note that if any files are open in the client, these commands have no effect.

Timeout client
To timeout a client, run the following command from the server machine:

# smbcontrol --timeout=100 smbd close-share tmp

Show more
After the timeout, the client is disconnected.

Alternatively, a timer can be mentioned in the smb.conf, as follows:

[global]
dead time = 1

Show more
Connect a client and keep the drive idle for a minute. The drive is disconnected after a minute.

Pinging client
To ping a client from the server machine, run the foillowing:

smbcontrol <pid of smbd> close-share <sharename>

Show more
For example:

#  smbcontrol 352494 ping
PONG from pid 352494

Show more
The response from client is a PONG message.

Trace and log capabilities
Samba offers logs for both daemons, nmbd and smbd. The nmbd logs are appended to /var/log.nmbd and the smbd logs are appended to /var/log.smbd.

Salient features and configuration
This section discusses some salient features in Samba and how to configure them.

User-level security
The authentication described in the previous section is user-level security. Here users are defined in the Samba server. The client authenticates through one of the users defined in the server. The global option in smb.conf is:

[global]
    security = user

Show more
This is the default option for the Samba server.

Share-level security
A standard internal user list is compiled in Samba consisting of users such as nobody, Administrator, and more. Access to a file or printer resource is based on successfully authenticating as any one of these standard users.

If a resource should be accessible only by a specific user, it is configured in smb.conf as follows:

[global]
  security = share

[tmp]
  only user = yes
user = ann
path = /tmp

[samba]
       path = /samba

Show more
In this configuration example, /tmp can be accessed only by ann, but /samba can be accessed by a guest user.

The only user option indicates whether Samba allows connections to a share using share-level security based solely on the individuals specified in the username option, instead of those users compiled on Samba’s internal list (nobody, Administrator, etc.). The default value for this option is no.

Server-level security
Server-level security is a kind of security in which authentication can be passed to another server. This is also referred as pass-through authentication. The following is the configuration in smb.conf:

[global]
 workgroup = IN.IBM.COM
 encrypt passwords = yes
 security = server
 password server = jhelum.in.ibm.com

[share2]
  comment = mnt
  path = /home/mary/mnt2
  read only = No
  valid users = mary

[share1]
  comment = mary
  path = /home/mary/mnt1
 writeable = yes
 valid users = nobody

Show more
In this example, the user “mary” is allowed to access share2 and “nobody” is allowed to access share1.

Domain controller capabilities
The domain controller is the authenticator for all machines in that domain, both Windows and AIX. A domain usually pertains to the same subnet. Samba can act as a domain controller. The smb.conf should contain code as shown below:

[global]
    workgroup = SAMBA
    security = user
    domain master = yes
    local master = yes
    preferred master = yes
    os level = 65
    domain logons = yes
    add machine script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /var/lib/nobody -g 100 %u

Show more
In Windows client settings, join the Samba domain. Add permissions from the Samba domain to the remote user list. These users do not necessarily exist in Windows, but do exist in the Samba domain.

Samba is a domain controller. Windows is a member of the domain. When a domain is selected and the user name and password are input from the Windows client, the request for authentication goes to the Samba server. You can implement a pass-through to another Samba server, which is a domain controller, as follows:

[global]
        security = server
            password server = jhelum.in.ibm.com

Show more
Here jhelum is running the Samba server and is the domain controller. The authentication is passed to jhelum.

In case the domain controller is not known for adding in smb.conf, the Samba server can search for the same in the domain. This should be indicated as follows in smb.conf:

password server = *

Show more
Active Directory support
If an Active Directory (AD) server is installed in Windows, Samba can be configured to re-direct all incoming connections to the Active Directory server for authentication.

This can be achieved as follows.

Create user rocky in both AD as well as in Samba, with different passwords. Assume AD is installed in the Windows client 9.124.101.235. Configure smb.conf as follows:

[global]
        WORKGROUP = mygroup
        security = server
        password server = 9.124.101.235

[tmp]
        path = /tmp
        msdfs root = yes
        public = yes

[rocky]
        path = /home/rocky
        public = yes

Show more
Map as user rocky using the two different passwords (for Samba and AD). Both authenticate.

Multi-user logon
Multi-user logon capability allows multiple clients to access the shared resources through one connection with the server.

To test this capability, install Windows Terminal Server in a Windows machine. Reboot the machine. Map a drive to the Samba server. Connect to this Windows machine from another client through the Remote Desktop service.

You should be able to see the mapped drive and access it as usual without a password prompt. Just logging into that machine is enough.

There should be interactions only between the mapped client and the Samba server. The second client’s IP does not appear anywhere, while still interacting with the Samba server.

Guest logon
Guest logon can be enabled by setting the following parameter in smb.conf:

[global]
security = user
    guest ok = yes

Show more
The guest account can be implemented for wrong passwords or wrong usernames. If the option is bad password, then the server logs in for all/nil password. If it is bad user, the server logs only for wrong usernames, not in Samba. This is shown as follows:

[global]
        map to guest = Bad user

Show more
The user that is assigned for guest logon is indicated by a parameter guest account:

[global]

   guest account = mary

Show more
Username mapping
Samba allows for the enforcement of specific users or permissions on a shared file or printer.

The following options can be used in the definition of a share:

    ##force permissions on files created on a share
create mask = 0777

##force permissions on directories created on a share
directory mask = 0444

## force user and group for files and directories created on a share
force user = root (username)
force group = system (groupname)

Show more
Connect a Windows client drive to the share with any other user (not root) that has read/write permissions and create a new file. Check the permissions of the file that is created in that share. You can see that the new file has the permissions of root and system.

To allow only specific users to read/write to a share, the following configuration should be used in smb.conf:

[tmp]
path = /tmp
writable = no
write list = root
 read list = root

Show more
Password encryption
When password encryption is disabled in Samba, authentication is done by AIX. Samba authenticates only when password encryption is enabled.

Add the following in smb.conf:

[global]
     password encryption = no

Show more
Create a user in AIX that does not exist in Samba. If you connect a drive in the Windows client, using this user you find that AIX authenticates the user. Now change the following in smb.conf:

[global]
     password encryption = yes

Show more
Try to connect the above user. It should fail, stating that the user does not exist.

This shows that AIX authenticates the user, when the user is present in AIX and not in Samba when encryption is turned off. Samba authenticates when the password is encrypted, as in the second case above.

MSDFS feature
MSDFS allows multiple file servers to be seamlessly integrated into one logical namespace, which results in the following:

A single drive-mapping can be used to access multiple file servers, possibly dispersed across the entire network.
Multiple file servers can be mapped to the same name, thus providing redundancy and locality of data access.
This complexity of logical and physical topology appears as a single directory tree (drive mapping), with sub-directories that may actually be located on remote servers.
MSDFS is organized as a topology of MSDFS root file shares, which can contain MSDFS links to other local or remote file shares. These MSDFS links appear as sub-directories, and so that transparent re-direction to the remote file shares occurs, as long as the user is properly authenticated at the remote servers. (Windows client software manages the MSDFS re-direct and remote-server authentication.)

To use this feature in Samba, the smb.conf file should mention the MSDFS root.

    [global]
            host msdfs  = yes
            security = user

[tmp]
            path = /tmp
            msdfs root = yes
            public = yes

Show more
Link to the DFS root as follows:

cd /tmp
ln -s msdfs:beas.in.ibm.com\\radhika t1

Show more
where beas.in.ibm.com\radhika is a share and beas is also running Samba, and is compiled with the –with-msdfs option. If you map the tmp share from a Windows client, the directories of t1 can be accessed. Thus, this feature allows directories of one share to be universally accessed from a DFS root.

ACL support
Samba supports both AIXC and NFSv4 ACL. The following are the configuration details for using NFSv4 ACL with Samba.

Create a new file system with v2=extended attribute /samba. Check the ACL types supported by the file system:

# aclgettypes /samba
Supported ACL types are:
        AIXC
        NFS4

Show more
Create a new file called test1.txt and check the ACL of that file:

# aclget test1.txt
*
* ACL_type   AIXC
*
attributes:
base permissions
    owner(root):  rw-
    group(system):  r--
    others:  r--
extended permissions
    enabled

Show more
If extended permissions is disabled, enable it. Convert the ACL type of test1.txt to NFS4:

# aclconvert -t NFS4 test1.txt

Show more
Get the ACL on test1.txt:

# aclget test1.txt
*
* ACL_type   NFS4
*
*
* Owner: root
* Group: system
*
s:(OWNER@):     a       rwpRWaAdcCs
s:(OWNER@):     d       xo
s:(GROUP@):     a       rRadcs
s:(GROUP@):     d       wpWxACo
s:(EVERYONE@):  a       rRadcs
s:(EVERYONE@):  d       wpWxACo

Include a new share for the created filesystem in smb.conf:
[samba]
   path = /samba
   public = yes

Show more
There is no predictable mapping between UNIX mapping and NFS4 ACL. Hence, it can be misleading if you compare NFSv4 ACL and permissions in the ls listing.

Map a drive from the Windows client using the user “john” (who belongs to the system group). Create a new file in /samba. The server does not allow deletion of that file. Access is denied for delete, as D is denied for that group.

SMB signing
SMB signing provides mutual authentication and message authentication capabilities for the Samba server. By default, SMB signing is disabled. If enabled, each message is also validated with a digital signature.

The following should be added to smb.conf to enable SMB signing:

server signing = yes

Show more
Enable SMB signing in the Windows client. Thereafter, the SMB header contains the comment “Security signatures are enabled.”

Large file support
Large files are those whose sizes exceed 4G. The Samba server supports large files by default. It does not require any specific parameter to be set. To test this feature, transfer a large file from AIX to the Windows client through a mapped drive. It will be successful.

Print services
Printer resources in AIX can be shared across and accessed from Windows clients.

Consider the following print queues configured in AIX.

# lpstat
Queue  Dev  Status   Job Files     User       PP %   Blks  Cp Rnk
------ ---- -------- --- ---------- ------ ---- -- --- --- ---
badq    lxx   READY
52ps    hp@9  READY
52cl    hp@9  READY
52vcl   lxx   READY

Show more
The printer share can be added in smb.conf as follows:

# cat /usr/lib/smb.conf
[global]
        print command = /usr/bin/lpr -r -P%p %s
        lpq command = cat %p >> /tmp/lpq.log ;/usr/bin/lpq -P%p
        lprm command = /usr/bin/lprm -P%p %j

[52vcl]
        printable = yes
        use client driver = yes
        browseable = yes
        print command = /usr/bin/lp -d 52vcl %s
        path = /tmp
        printing = AIX
        guest ok = yes
        print ok = Yes

Show more
You can see the configured printer in the Windows network neighborhood in the same subnet. Alternatively, in the other subnets, add the networked printer as a new printer.

You can test print using the SMB client as follows:

# smbclient //aixfvt49.in.ibm.com/52vcl -U joe
Password:
Anonymous login successful
Domain=[SAMBA] OS=[UNIX] Server=[Samba 3.0.26a]
smb: \> put /etc/motd
putting file /etc/motd as \/etc/motd (6.5 kb/s) (average 6.5 kb/s)
smb: \>

Show more
You can send requests from Windows to this networked printer.

DOS attribute mapping
Samba supports DOS file attributes with the following options:

map archive = yes
map system = yes
map hidden = yes

Show more
The following figure shows mapping of permissions with DOS attributes.

Figure 1. Permissions with DOS attributes
fig1
You can create a file in the shared directory with some permission bits. You can view the same using the SMB client tool as follows:

From AIX:

-rwxrwxrwx    1 john     staff       0 Jan 29 14:25 New Text Document (4).txt
-rwxrwxrwx    1 guest    usr         0 Feb 27 15:23 New Text Document (5).txt
drwxrwxrwx    2 ldapdb2  dbsysadm    256 Feb 08 10:46 SQLDIR.LK0

Show more
From smbclient:

New Text Document (4).txt         AHS       0  Tue Jan 29 14:25:56 2008
New Text Document (5).txt         AHS       0  Wed Feb 27 15:23:34 2008
SQLDIR.LK0                     D       0  Fri Feb  8 10:46:05 2008

Show more
Directory change notification
Teh directory change notification feature is implemented by default in Samba. Samba generates an “NT NOTIFY” message when a change to a directory is made from the client, such as creating a new file.

In case the change interval has to be changed, edit the smb.conf as follows:

change notify timeout = 10

Show more
The iptrace shows NT NOTIFY requests and responses.

NETBIOS-less connections
Disable NETBIOS over TCP/IP in a Windows client and reboot. Now connect a drive. The connection is successful, indicating that NETBIOS-less connections are possible in Samba.

Resource browsing protocol
Samba is visible in the network neighborhood of Windows clients in the same subnet.

This can be tested as follows. A Windows client machine in the same subnet as the Samba server is required. Assume that the Samba server runs in jhelum and 9.124.113.100 is a Windows client in the same subnet.

Edit the smb.conf as follows:

[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  security = user
[samba4]
  path = /samba4
  writeable = yes
valid users = root

Show more
Now browse the network neighborhood in the Windows client. You can see the Samba server in the network neighborhood of the client.

Browse master functionality
Network browsing is a concept that enables Windows and Samba servers to appear in the Windows network neighborhood. Inside the network neighborhood, icons are represented as servers and if opened, the server’s shares and printers that are available are displayed.

A domain master browser collates the browse lists from the local master browsers on all subnets so that browsing can occur between workgroups and subnets. Also, the domain master browser should preferably be the local master browser for its own subnet.

Samba can act as browse master with the following setting:

[global]
   local master = yes
   preferred master = yes
   WORKGROUP = SAMBA

Show more
The interval in seconds for which nmbd can wait before repeatedly broadcasting LAN Manager announcements can be set as follows in smb.conf:

lm interval = 120

Show more
Now test the connectivity from a Windows client.

Test the browse master functionality using the SMB client tool as follows:

# smbclient -L //aixfvt21.in.ibm.com/tmp
Password:
Anonymous login successful
Domain=[SAMBA] OS=[UNIX] Server=[Samba 3.0.26a]
        Sharename       Type      Comment

        AIXFVT21             Samba 3.0.26a

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------
SAMBA   AIXFVT21

Show more
The following is the relevant excerpt from log.nmbd:

[2008/03/27 13:22:10, 0] nmbd/nmbd_become_lmb.c:become_local_master_stage2(396)
  *****

Show more
Samba name server AIXFVT21 is now a local master browser for the workgroup SAMBA on subnet 9.124.101.199

Note that local master = yes guarantees that Samba will participate in the election and that’s all it does. preferred master = yes forces browse election when Samba first comes on-line.

Problem determination
Tracing
The message packets between client and server can be traced using the tcpdump command in AIX.

Start the tcpdump command in the server as follows:

tcpdump -s 0 -w <tracefile> host <hostname> and <hostname/ipaddress>

Show more
For example:

tcpdump -s 0 -w cap_1.cap host aixfvt21 and 9.126.241.144

Show more
The transaction between the client and server should be completed and then the tcpdump can be killed. The trace file created can be viewed using Ethereal or any tool.

Logs
/var/log.smbd records messages from the SMB daemon and /var/log.nmbd records messages from the nmb daemon.

The log levels can be increased by the following in smb.conf:

[global]
    log level = 5

Show more
The logs can be looked at for any error messages, whenever it is required.

Conclusion
This article showed how to set up and configure the Samba server. You saw how shares can be defined and accessed from Windows. Different authentication mechanisms are also discussed.
